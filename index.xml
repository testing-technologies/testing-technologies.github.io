      <description>Larry Ward Chief Executive Officer   Larry Ward is in his third career.
He started out working for a Congressman in Washington DC as a legislative assistant. &amp;ldquo;I worked my way through college waiting tables. Washington DC was like a finishing school for me. Being at the seat of &amp;ldquo;power&amp;rdquo; taught me how to keep things in perspective, and not be overly impressed by anyone’s title or rank.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Full I-502 Cannabis Testing Full I-502 cannabis testing includes cannabis potency testing, microbial screening, analysis for moisture, water activity, mycotoxins, and testing for residual solvents.
Cannabinoids Analysis Our cannabinoid method quantifies CBGA, CBG, CBD, CBDA, CBDV, CBN, CBC, Δ9-THC, THCA, Δ8-THC, and THCV in various cannabis based products including flower, extracts, concentrates, tinctures, topical products and edibles.
We separate cannabinoids using liquid chromatography.
Moisture &amp;amp; Water Activity Our methods for testing moisture content in cannabis use an OHAUS MB45 to determine percent moisture, and measurement.</description>

      <description>Benjamin M. Hart Senior Scientist   Ben is no stranger to drug testing. He worked several years for Keystone Labratories, Inc. doing forensic drug testing. He was the Director of Technology and Certifying Scientist. Ben was in charge of their forensic drug testing lab. He was the chief of personnel, and directed all the new instrument purchases.
His skills for instrument maintenance, reviewing and certifying results, and method development made him the ideal candidate to become our Senior Scientist.</description>

      <title>Microbiology Panel</title>
      <link>https://testing-technologies.github.io/services/panels/microbiology/</link>

      <description>Microbial Testing Why is Microbial Testing Important?  Microbiological contaminants can cause illness and potentially death for patients with compromised immune systems. Washington state requires that all I-502 recreational marijuana is tested for microbial contamination. Medical growers are strongly advised to test as well.
 Microbial contaminants can affect your grow or production facility, resulting in deteriorated and low quality product and substantial loss of revenue.
  The safety and health of consumers is of utmost importance to responsible cannabis businesses.</description>

      <title>Residual Solvents Panel</title>
      <link>https://testing-technologies.github.io/services/panels/solvents/</link>

      <guid>https://testing-technologies.github.io/services/panels/solvents/</guid>
      <description>Residual Solvent Testing Highly concentrated oils and purified extracts are created through the use of Hydrocarbon gases and organic solvents. If the proper quality measurements are not taken the finished product will contain residue from the gasses or solvents that the consumer could ingest or inhale.
Testing Technologies can test for residual solvents in extracts, or edibles. To detect residual solvents we use GC-FID coupled with headspace analysis. We follow the residual solvents method USP 467.</description>

      <title>Terpene Panel</title>
      <link>https://testing-technologies.github.io/services/panels/terpenes/</link>

      <description>What Are Terpenes? Terpenes are aromatic molecules found in marijuana that gives it the distinctive smell. Thousands of terpenes are found in the plant kingdom, and there are more than one hundred compounds found in cannabis alone.
As a cannabis plant grows and matures from fertility to senescence, the resins containing terpenes change in viscosity as well and its components. Terpenes in cannabis are divided into two chemical classifications, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, the former being more volatile.</description>

      <title>Potency Panel</title>
      <link>https://testing-technologies.github.io/services/panels/potency/</link>

      <guid>https://testing-technologies.github.io/services/panels/potency/</guid>
      <description>Cannabinoid Extraction Potency testing begins with the extraction of the cannabinoids. Testing Technologies uses the most advanced extraction techniques in the industry. Our extraction methods guarantee that the molecules of interest are fully extracted and not left behind. Incomplete extractions can result in low and inaccurate results.
Our extraction method is not only the best in the industry, it is also significantly less wasteful and more environmentally friendly than other methods currently in use.</description>

      <description>Josh LaVecchia Director of Microbiolgy   Josh is one of those people that likes to talk about cell physiology, cytology and microscopic technique, immunology, pathogenic microbiology, prokaryotic physiology and genetics, biochemistry, organic and analytical chemistries. That is science nerd to the 4th power.
He came to us by way of Texas. He cut his teeth so to speak working for a large testing lab there that did primarily blood testing.</description>

      <description>Stephen Chambers Science Director   As our science director, Stephen&amp;rsquo;s primary function is to insure that our lab is following GLP (Good Lab Practices). Good Lab Practices isn&amp;rsquo;t just a phrase, it is a system of requirements that insures that a laboratory, any laboratory, is functioning in a manner that meets basic requirements for acceptable science.
More importantly for us, this most important function ensures that your samples&amp;rsquo; results are going to be based upon science and that they are a true representation of the sample we are supplied.</description>
