      <description>Larry Ward Chief Executive Officer   Larry Ward is in his third career.
He started out working for a Congressman in Washington DC as a legislative assistant. &amp;ldquo;I worked my way through college waiting tables. Washington DC was like a finishing school for me. Being at the seat of &amp;ldquo;power&amp;rdquo; taught me how to keep things in perspective, and not be overly impressed by anyoneâ€™s title or rank.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Josh LaVecchia Director of Microbiolgy   Josh is one of those people that likes to talk about cell physiology, cytology and microscopic technique, immunology, pathogenic microbiology, prokaryotic physiology and genetics, biochemistry, organic and analytical chemistries. That is science nerd to the 4th power.
He came to us by way of Texas. He cut his teeth so to speak working for a large testing lab there that did primarily blood testing.</description>

      <description>Stephen Chambers Science Director   As our science director, Stephen&amp;rsquo;s primary function is to insure that our lab is following GLP (Good Lab Practices). Good Lab Practices isn&amp;rsquo;t just a phrase, it is a system of requirements that insures that a laboratory, any laboratory, is functioning in a manner that meets basic requirements for acceptable science.
More importantly for us, this most important function ensures that your samples&amp;rsquo; results are going to be based upon science and that they are a true representation of the sample we are supplied.</description>
